This directory houses a code that verifies the MCC3s by comparing energies calculated by them
against energies calculated by whatever LAMMPS potential they were produced with. 

BEFORE RUNNING,
mkdir debug_in
mkdir debug_ifc2mcc

verify with:

./geo verify random 5 0.1 10101 MCC3_REF

to verify against random 5 configs, 0.1 atomic displacement magnitude, 10101 random seed, and MCC3_REF filename

Do finite difference (for IFCs) with (e.g.):

mpirun -np 2 fcfd fd 0.1 4 

where 0.1 is stepsize, and 4 is the order.

Then do an ASR correction to 2nd order:

./fcfd asr 2

which creates FC2_ASR.

To convert IFCs to MCCs up to 3rd order, for 8 atom system:

    fcfd ifc2mcc 0 3 # This is 0 for converting, and 3 for order
    NOTE: You must make /mcc3 and /mcc4 folders so that the program can write files in these folders!

To extract MCC3s from the /mcc3 directory, do:

    fcfd ifc2mcc 1 lowmode highmode
    # "lowmode" and "highmode" are the intervals of modes to extract. Could possibly add a list later. 

To calculate PR of an 8 atom system (requires EMAT):
    fcfd compute pr 8

To average MCC3s of modes i, from a list of modes i, do:

    fcfd ifc2mcc 2

and make sure you have an ILIST file full of modes i that you want to average MCC3 tensors for.
